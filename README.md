🟢 PROJECT COMPLETED: Mapping Healthcare Accessibility in Shagari LGA, Sokoto State Nigeria

I'm excited to share my latest geospatial analysis project - mapping health facility service areas (2km & 5km reachability) for Shagari Local Government Area in Sokoto State, Nigeria.

Using OpenRouteService API and Python, I analyzed 30+ health facilities to determine:
📍 2km walking distance coverage (15 min)
📍 5km walking distance coverage (30 min) 
📍 Underserved areas requiring intervention
📍 Facility distribution across 8 wards

📊 KEY FINDINGS:
✅ 5km coverage reaches 88.9% of Shagari LGA
⚠️ 155.62km² still underserved (>5km from nearest facility) 10.8%
🏥 Shagari General Hospital serves as central referral point

🛠️ TOOLS USED:
• Python (GeoPandas, Folium, OpenRouteService)
• QGIS for final map production
• NHFR/GRID3 facility data

This analysis provides actionable insights for:
📌 Health policy makers
📌 NGO partners working on UHC
📌 Sokoto State Ministry of Health
📌 Development partners
